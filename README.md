## "proof of compression" self-optimizing data storage network

a file storage network and the mining would consist of trying to find better and better ways of compressing different subsets of the data by applying brute-force intense and advanced compression methods. 

gains in compression would be monetized, and nodes in the network use the learned compression methods to continuously improve the storage efficiency of replicated data.
